# FirstProgram

The purpose of this program is to learn

* The purpose of #include <iostream>
* That all programs need exactly ONE main function
* How to declare a variable in c++
* Getting input from the user 
* Storing that input to the variable
* Doing a regular print for the user to see

Realize that main is returning an int. So, we return 0 to show that everything ran correctly.
